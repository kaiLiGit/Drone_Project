# Drone_Project
  -This repository is dedicated to the NASA drone project Team at Miami University.
  -The repository currently include experiment code from DroneKit.
  -As the project progresses, the aim is to work based on the existing code 
   provided from the simple_goto.py and add new features such that our drone vehicle 
   will fly from one waypoint to another waypoint repetitively before the baterry drains 
   below 10% of its maximum capacity.
